    <para>Knowing how to change a tire is a necessary skill for all drivers. If you rely on a cell
        phone to save you in a roadside emergency, there’s always that chance you will forget to
        charge it, be out of range, or leave it at home. Flat tires can happen anywhere, and a cell
        phone is no substitute for knowing how to change a flat tire.</para>
    <para>Thankfully, changing a tire isn’t all that hard! Just adhere to the following guidelines

    <para>If you have misplaced any of these items, or if your car did not come with these items,

        tire to your vehicle manufacturer’s recommended PSI. You should check the spare’s air
        pressure every time you check your other tires. Remember to check pressure every month and
        before long trips or carrying extra load.</para>
    <para>Here are some items that don’t come with your vehicle but that you should stow in your

    CHANGE TIRES 1. FIND A SAFE LOCATION As soon as you realize you have a flat tire, do not
    abruptly brake or turn. Slowly reduce speed and scan your surroundings for a level, straight
    stretch of road with a wide shoulder. An empty parking lot would be an ideal place. Level ground
    is good because it will prevent your vehicle from rolling. Also, straight stretches of road are
    better than curves because oncoming traffic is more likely to see you. Never attempt to change
    your tire on a narrow shoulder near oncoming traffic. Keep moving (slowly) until you find a
    safer spot. While driving on a flat risks ruining your rim, replacing a rim is better than being
    hit by an inattentive driver. Make sure to consult your owner’s manual and review their specific
    steps on how to change a flat tire for your vehicle 2. TURN ON YOUR HAZARD LIGHTS Your hazard
    lights or “flashers” will help other drivers see you on the side of the road. To avoid an
    accident, turn them on as soon as you realize you need to pull over. 3. APPLY THE PARKING BRAKE
    Once stopped, always use the parking brake when preparing to replace a flat tire. This will
    minimize the possibility of your vehicle rolling. 4. APPLY WHEEL WEDGES Wheel wedges go in front
    of or behind the tires to further ensure the vehicle doesn’t roll while you fix the flat tire.
    If you’re changing a rear tire, place these in front of the front tires. If your flat tire is at
    the front, put the wheel wedges behind the rear tires. Bricks or large stones will work just as
    well as “real” wheel wedges. Just be sure they’re large enough to stop the car from rolling. 5.
    REMOVE THE HUBCAP OR WHEEL COVER If your vehicle has a hubcap covering the lug nuts, it’s easier
    to remove the hubcap before lifting the vehicle with the jack. If your lug nuts are exposed, you
    can skip ahead to Step 6. Use the flat end of your lug wrench to remove the hubcap. This will
    work for most vehicles, but some hubcaps need a different tool to come off. Consult your owner’s
    manual for proper hubcap or wheel cover removal procedures. 6. LOOSEN THE LUG NUTS Using the lug
    wrench, turn the lug nuts counterclockwise until you break their resistance. You may have to use
    force, and that’s ok. Use your foot or all of your body weight if necessary. Loosen the lug nuts
    about ¼ to ½ of a turn, but don’t remove them completely yet. Save that for when it’s time to
    remove your tire/wheel from the vehicle. 7. PLACE THE JACK UNDER THE VEHICLE The right place for
    the jack is usually beneath the vehicle frame alongside the tire that’s flat. Many vehicle
    frames have molded plastic on the bottom with a cleared area of exposed metal specifically for
    the jack. To safely lift and avoid damage to the vehicle, follow the instructions for jack
    placement in your vehicle owner’s manual. 8. RAISE THE VEHICLE WITH THE JACK To prevent the jack
    from settling under the weight of your vehicle and coming off balance, place a small cut of 2x6”
    wood beneath it before attempting to raise your vehicle. This tactic is especially helpful on
    asphalt. With the jack properly positioned, raise the vehicle until the flat tire is about six
    inches above the ground. Never put any part of your body under the vehicle during or after
    raising the vehicle with the jack. 9. UNSCREW THE LUG NUTS Now it’s time to remove the lug nuts
    all the way. Since you've already loosened them, you should be able to unscrew them mostly by
    hand. 10. REMOVE THE FLAT TIRE Gripping the tire by the treads, pull it gently toward you until
    it’s completely free from the hub behind it. Set it on its side so that it doesn’t roll away.
    11. MOUNT THE SPARE TIRE ON THE LUG BOLTS Now place the spare on the hub by lining up the rim
    with the lug bolts. Push gently until the lug bolts show through the rim. 12. TIGHTEN THE LUG
    NUTS BY HAND Put the lug nuts back on the lug bolts and tighten them all the way by hand. Once
    they are all on, check each one again, tightening as much as possible. You will tighten them
    with the wrench after lowering the vehicle to the ground. 13. LOWER THE VEHICLE AND TIGHTEN THE
    LUG NUTS AGAIN Use the jack to lower the vehicle so that the spare tire is resting on the ground
    but the full weight of the vehicle isn’t fully on the tire. At this point, you should tighten
    the lug nuts with the wrench, turning clockwise, as much as you can. Push down on the lug wrench
    with the full weight of your body. 14. LOWER THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY Bring the vehicle all the
    way to the ground and remove the jack. Give the lug nuts another pull with the wrench to ensure
    they’re as tight as possible. 15. REPLACE THE HUBCAP If the hubcap you took from the flat tire
    will fit your spare, put it in place the same way you removed it initially. If it doesn’t fit,
    stow it away with the tire when you stow your equipment. 16. STOW ALL EQUIPMENT You have before
    you a jack, a lug wrench, wheel wedges, your flat tire, and possibly a hubcap. Don’t forget to
    put all of them in your vehicle before driving away. 17. CHECK THE PRESSURE IN THE SPARE TIRE
    You should check the tire pressure of the spare tire to make sure that it is safe to drive on.
    “T-Type” temporary spares, also called “mini-spares,” require 60 psi (420 kPa). If the tire
    needs pressure, drive (slowly) to a service station immediately. 18. TAKE YOUR FLAT TIRE TO A
    TECHNICIAN Temporary spare tires aren’t made to drive long distances or at high speeds, so drive
    cautiously until you’re able to visit a tire technician. A professional should be able to
    determine whether your tire needs a repair or if it’s time to replace it. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE
    TO FIX A FLAT TIRE? Aside from taking your tire to a professional, the above procedure shouldn’t
    take more than 15 to 30 minutes to change a tire. Just be sure you don’t leave out any steps.
    It’s beneficial practice changing a tire in your garage or driveway to ensure you’re ready to
    handle this situation if it ever happens to you. A FEW MORE TIPS ON CHANGING TIRES Knowing how
    to fix a flat tire is great, but regular tire maintenance is even more important. In addition to
    reviewing this guide regularly, remember to do the following: Keep your tires properly inflated
    Rotate your tires according to the manufacturer’s guidelines Monitor for tread wear All of these
    precautions will extend the life of your tires and reduce the likelihood of a flat. While
    there’s no way to prevent flat tires completely, proper care can improve performance and ensure
    your tires last as long as possible. CONTINUE YOUR JOURNEY There’s never a good time for a flat.
